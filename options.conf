This is an example file to show you how to use it.
Most settings here are in CamelCase and this is required! (for now)

Now to IRC:
	- you need to define servers (and give them a name)
	- you need to define channels and match them to a server (to the name you gave them)
	
s_server	= *name (for adding channels)*; *address*; *port*; *use SSL*; *userName*; *password*; *nickName*; *realName*
s_channel 	= *server name*; *irc channel name*; *irc channel key (optional)*; *RetroShare lobby name for the bridge*

SSL is not supported right now!

[irc]
# example:
#s_server		= freenode; irc.freenode.net; 6667; 0; Bridge;; Bridge; Bridge-realNick

# add channels
#s_channel		= freenode; #retroshare;; RetroShare on IRC
#s_channel		= freenode; #libre-mesh;; libre-mesh
#s_channel		= freenode; #eigenlab;; eigenlab

The bot is able to listen to command in a special private lobby. Keep in mind that everybody who has access to the lobby can control the bot since the lobbies are anonymous.
And don't forget that the bot must be able to see/access the lobby!

Commands are:
  /options		lists all current options
  /lobbies		lists all visible lobbies
  /blacklist	lists current lobby black list
  /commands		lists all available commands
  /clearblacklist	clears lobby blacklist

  /join *lobby name*
  /leave *lobby name*
	use %all% for all lobbies - obviously the bot won't leave the control lobby
  /autojoin 1/0
  /autojoinall 1/0
  /leavelobbies 1/0	(at shut down)
  /autocreate 1/0
  /leaveonmsg 1/0
  /useblacklist	1/0

  /autoreponse 1/0

  /restart		restarts the bot - useful to load new options
  /reload		same as /restart
  /off			turn bot off - useful to shut down the daemon

Hint:
  You can change the '/' to what ever you want

[control]
b_enable		= 1
s_lobbyName		= Bot Control Room
s_leadingChar	= !

Now it's getting tricky! Each rule can be used by every interface. Basic format:

  *name of rule* = *options*
  *option* = *used by*; *allow context*; *separated*; *has leading character*; *leading character*; *search for*; *answer* 

Name:
  name for the rule - has no functionality.

Options:
  separator ';'
  *used by*			= flag 
	enter as decimal - hope you know how to convert hex to dec :P
	you can combine them too: IRC + RS = 0x03
	0x00	all
	0x01	Retroshare
	0x02	IRC

  *allow context*		= boolean
	"/help"		<-- no context
	"use /help"	<-- context

  *separated*			= boolean
	"bla/commandbla" 	<-- not separated
	"bla /command bla" 	<-- separated

  *has leading character*	= boolean
	"/command"	<-- leading character is '/'
	"command"	<-- no leading character

  *leading character*	= char
	optional - only needed when *has leading character* is used

  *search for*		= string
	the keyword(s) the auto response should search for e.g. "help"
	can be combined with a leading character like "/help"

  *answer* 			= string
	the answer that should be displayed (supporting replacement see below)

Replacements:
  %nick%	will be replaced with the sender's nickname
  %ownnick%	will be replaced with the bot's name

Hint:
  HTML-Tags are allowed (e.g. <br> for e new line)
  <b> seems to not work
  obviously HTML won't work in IRC
